#Paella Recorder usage and features guide

##Basic usage

The Paella Recorder is designed to enable the recording of a video with the presentation's slides.

###Record your video

When the PDF finishes to load, you can start your recording by pressing the button "Start Recording".
You'll be able to pause and resume during your recording by pressing the "Pause" and "Resume" buttons which will replace the "Start Recording" button.
When you want to stop your recording, press the "Stop recording" button.
By pressing the "<" and ">" buttons, you can change the displayed slide. When it's recording, the timing of your change will be saved to be displayed on the Paella Player after.
